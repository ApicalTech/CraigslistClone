# Security Policy
I greatly value not only my privacy but also the privacy of any contributors.
- All data is stored locally as of now, as a stretch goal I would like to move user information to the cloud.
- All user data should be encrypted and stored locally, however I suggest using dummy data for testing.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- If you notice a vulerability, please contact me at ( anthony.ms.ardiente@gmail.com ). This will be moved to the top of the priority list.
